# YouTube Deep Dive Summarizer (Llama 3 & Streamlit)

Tired of clickbait titles and 2-hour videos that could have been a 5-minute read? This tool acts as your personal research analyst, transforming any YouTube video into a structured, detailed "Intelligence Brief."

Using a locally-run Llama 3 model, this application goes beyond simple summarization. It intelligently filters out promotional fluff ("like and subscribe!") and deconstructs the core content into actionable insights, detailed explanations, and key quotes.
